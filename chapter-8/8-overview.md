# Conclusions and Future Work

## Overview

The aim of this thesis was to develop an educational game for mobile devices, which will introduce learners to the basic principles of Quantum Computing. The main objectives of the thesis were:

1. The game to be an effective learning tool and to successfully introduce the basic concepts of quantum computing to university students.

2. The game should be enjoyable and simple so as not to distract the student from the learning objective.

3. The game should be short and require no additional equipment beyond a mobile phone, making it an effective learning tool that can be utilized during a university lecture or when students have limited time.

The five components of educational game design that should be considered, according to the literature, are:

1. Mechanics

2. Narrative

3. Aesthetics

4. Technology

5. Pedagogy

The development of the application followed was an iterative process, as shown in _Figure 8.1_ and discussed in _Chapter 6_.

The source code of the application has been published on _GitHub_^[https://github.com/StelTheo73/qubity] under the _GNU General Public License v3.0_ License. The application is available as an _APK_^[https://github.com/StelTheo73/qubity/blob/main/release], for installation on Android devices.

The evaluation of the application was carried out using a mix of methods:

1. **Pre-Post Tests**: Evaluation of learning outcomes and knowledge retention

2. **System Usability Scale (SUS) Questionnaire**: Evaluation of the application as an interactive system

3. **Game User Experience Satisfaction Scale (GUESS-18) Questionnaire**: Evaluation of game experience

4. **Focus Group**: qualitative feedback and validation of questionnaire results

## Conclusions

### Literature Review Conclusions

From literature review, we concluded the following:

1. The game should belong to the Puzzle genre, as games of this kind have simple rules and mechanisms, they enhance information retention and the majority of educational games - related to quantum computing - belong to this category.

2. In order for the game to be attractive, easy to use and enjoyable, it should include elements and techniques of Game Based Learning, such as:
   - Adaptivity
   - Graceful Failure
   - Incentive System
   - Information Visualization with interactive graphic elements
   - Musical Score
   - Narratives

3. There are few educational mobile applications related to quantum computing and most of them are no longer available.

4. The Quantum Computing theory presented in the game will include concepts such as:
   - Quantum Bits
   - Quantum Registers
   - Quantum Gates: Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, Pauli-Z, Pauli-Z, Hadamard
   - Superposition

### Evaluation Conclusions

The research objectives are met, and the game can be considered a successful educational tool, that also provides an enjoyable gaming experience and boosts knowledge retention. Game duration is short, and it can be played on a mobile phone without any additional equipment, so the game is suitable for use in the context of university lecture, as a supplementary educational tool or as a way to enhance engagement and interest for the subject. The results of the questionnaires and the focus group are mutually supportive and confirm our findings, indicating that the game is an easy-to-use, enjoyable, accessible and engaging learning tool, while having simple mechanics and rules. On the other hand, the game has some limitations, such as the limited number of levels, the lack of advanced concepts of quantum computing and the absence of audio and social features.

## Future Work

As discussed in the previous sections, the evaluation process provided valuable feedback that can be used to improve the game in the future. The game should be further expanded to include more levels, more complex puzzles, and additional features to enhance user experience and introduce more advanced concepts of quantum computing. Extra slides could be added to the tutorial level to provide more detailed explanations of the concepts presented in the game. The levels could be grouped into categories based on the concepts they cover, allowing players to focus on specific areas of quantum computing. Audio elements could be added to enhance the gaming experience, such as sound effects for actions and background music. Social features could be implemented that would allow players to share their progress and achievements with friends, or to compete against each other on a leaderboard. Care should be taken to ensure that the game remains educational and not overly competitive. The game could also be translated into other languages to reach a wider audience. In addition, the application could be tested and adapted for use on other platforms, such as iOS and Web, to expand its accessibility, as the current version is only available for Android devices. Finally, the game should be evaluated with a larger sample size to further validate the findings and investigate if it can be used as an effective educational tool in a wider context.
