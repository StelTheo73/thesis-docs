# Overview

The aim of this thesis was to develop an educational game for mobile devices, which will introduce learners to the basic principles of Quantum Computing. The main objectives of the thesis were:

1. The game to be an effective learning tool and to successfully introduce the basic concepts of quantum computing to university students.

2. The game should be enjoyable and simple so as not to distract the student from the learning objective.

3. The game should be short and require no additional equipment beyond a mobile phone, making it an effective learning tool that can be utilized during a university lecture or when students have limited time.

From literature review, we concluded the following:

1. The game should belong to the Puzzle genre, as games of this kind have simple rules and mechanisms, they enhance the information retention and the majority of educational games - related to quantum computing - belong to this category.

2. In order for the game to be attractive, easy to use and enjoyable, it should include elements and techniques of Game Based Learning, such as:
   - Adaptivity
   - Graceful Failure
   - Incentive System
   - Information Visualization with interactive graphic elements
   - Musical Score
   - Narratives

3. There are few educational mobile applications related to quantum computing and most of them are no longer available.

4. The Quantum Computing theory presented in the game will include concepts such as:
   - Quantum Bits
   - Quantum Registers
   - Quantum Gates: Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, Pauli-Z, Pauli-Z, Hadamard
   - Superposition

We decided to develop the application with the cross-platform framework Flutter and the Flame Game Engine, after comparing the available programming languages, frameworks and game engines. The application is a variant of the classic arcade game _Space Invaders_ and consists of 30 levels. It is a combination of Puzzle and Shooter game, where the player controls a spaceship, which moves horizontally and launches missiles upwards. The goal of each level is to destroy the asteroids on the screen.

The development of the application followed a Waterfall model, which consists of the following stages:

1. Conceptual Design

2. Wireframe for a Game Level

3. Application Structure Definition

4. Prototype Implementation

5. Prototype Evaluation and Improvements (Loop between 4 and 5)

6. Application Implementation

The evaluation of the application was carried out using a mix of methods:

1. **Pre-Post Tests**: Evaluation of learning outcomes and knowledge retention

2. **System Usability Scale (SUS) Questionnaire**: Evaluation of the application as an interactive system

3. **Game User Experience Satisfaction Scale (GUESS-18) Questionnaire**: Evaluation of game experience

4. **Focus Group**: qualitative feedback and validation of questionnaire results

Overall, the evaluation process was successful and provided valuable feedback that will be used to improve the game in the future. The research objectives are met, and the game can be considered a successful educational tool, that also provides an enjoyable gaming experience and boosts information retention. The game should be further expanded to include more levels, more complex puzzles, and additional features to enhance user experience and introduce more advanced concepts of quantum computing. The game should also be tested with a larger sample size to validate the findings.
