# Evaluation

## Quiz

To measure the educational value of the game, a 12-question quiz was designed. The quiz consists of 3 theoretical questions and 9 questions regarding quantum gates actions. The theoretical questions relate to the theory presented to the player via slides. The quantum gate questions ask the player to calculate the new state of a qubit after the gate has been applied to it, or ask the player to select the appropriate gate to perform a quantum calculation. The questions are designed to prove that the player has learned to use -some of- the gates introduced in chapter 4 and understands the concept of superposition.

## Evaluation Process & Outcomes

10 university students volunteered to participate in the evaluation of the game, which was carried out in 2 phases. The volunteers claimed to have a strong background in mathematics, with 4 of them having knowledge of complex numbers.

In the first phase, the game was shared with the players, and they were asked to complete the quiz before playing the game. Then, they were asked to complete the tutorial level and then complete the 30 levels of the game and retake the quiz. Players were given as much time as they wanted and were asked to record how long it took to complete the game. There was no further guidance on how the game works and no external help was provided to solve the levels. The results of the first evaluation phase are presented below:

As shown in the graphs above, the average score on the quiz was 8.33% before playing the game and 85% after completing the game. It is clear that players improved their knowledge of quantum computing by playing the game.

Statistical analysis showed no correlation between the time required to complete the game and the improvement in the quiz score. The average time needed to complete the game was 21 minutes. This makes the game suitable to be played in the context of a college lecture to increase student engagement in the classroom or to allow students to test their knowledge in a fun and interactive way.

In the second phage, 8 out of 10 players from the fist phase participated in a focus group. The questions they were asked to discuss were related to 4 areas; _User Interface & User Experience_ (UI & UX), _Game Mechanics_, _Difficulty_ and _Scoring & Rewards_. They were also free to discuss with each other and comment on their overall experience of the application. Below are the focus group findings by area:

### User Interface & User Experience

- One player requested an extra slide in the tutorial or in the first level, explaining how each level's score is calculated.

- One player requested that the _Next Level_ button should be a different color to others (on the level completion overlay).

- One player requested to group levels in the level selection menu by difficulty.

- Players agreed that the game menu was east to use and that the navigation worked well and was predictable.

- Players agreed that the state of the application was flawless and was updating correctly.

- Some players requested to add background music and sounds when launching missiles and hitting the targets.

### Game Mechanics

- Players found the mechanics simple and casual and commented that this simplicity helped them focus on solving the puzzles.

### Difficulty

- Players agreed that the game is easy and intended of users with no quantum computer experience. All of them could complete all 30 levels. They said they would like to try more difficult puzzles.

- Most players said that the hardest level was level 30 (the final one), as it required a combination of 3 gates to solve the puzzle.

- One player did not understand how the Hadamard gate acts on 2 qubits. Half of the players said they would like more information about superposition, but agreed that the theory presented was sufficient to solve the puzzles.

- One player suggested that there should be hints to use in case you find it difficult to solve the puzzle.

### Scoring & Rewards

- Players agreed that having a score system encouraged them to improve. 7 out of 8 players tried to complete all levels with 3 stars.

- Players agreed that they felt rewarded and motivated to keep playing by unlocking new spaceships as they progressed.

## Conclusions

Based on the feedback and data collected from the initial evaluation and focus group, several conclusions can be drawn:

1. The number of participants is small, only 10 people, so a complementary evaluation phase with a larger number of participants is suggested, for more reliable conclusions. However, the result of the initial evaluation is promising.

2. The duration of the game makes it suitable to be used as a teaching tool in the context of a lecture.

3. The UX should be improved, based on the feedback from the focus group.

4. The theory around superposition should be extended.

5. The game could be extended with more levels and quantum gates.
