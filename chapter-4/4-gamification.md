# Gamification and Game-Based Learning
https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/catalogs/tip-sheets/gamification-and-game-based-learning<br>

Gamification is the integration of game elements, such as point systems, leaderboards, badges or other game-related elements, into conventional learning activities in order to increase student engagement and motivation. In other words, it integrates game elements into existing learning activities.

On the other hand, game-based learning is the design of learning activities so that the characteristics and principles of games are a key feature of these activities.

## Game Elements
University of Waterloo [link to University of Waterloo] categorizes game elements into three main categories: Point Systems, Badges and Leaderboards.

### Point Systems
Points or Experience Systems reward students for completing tasks, just like conventional grades. They can introduce some useful features in learning environments, such as:

#### Limitless Points {.unnumbered}
While conventional grading systems collect learning artifacts that accumulate to one hundred percent of a course grade, point systems can accumulate points without a fixed end, pushing learners to do even better.

#### Flexible Goals {.unnumbered}
The courses can be structured to allow learners collect as many points as they want or force them complete a certain number of assignments to reach a desired threshold.

#### Student Choice {.unnumbered}
Learners can collect points by completing assignments or tests or any other course-relevant activities. They are free to choose how to collect points.

#### Tracking {.unnumbered}
Points can be tracked via grade books and shared with the entire class.

### Badges
Using badges can be a great way to reward learners for their work and keep them engaged and motivated. Badges can also be shared with the class to encourage competition.

### Leaderboards
The use of leaderboards is a great way to motivate learners, by providing them with constant feedback of where they rank in comparison to other group members. There are two types of leaderboards, absolute and relative.

#### Absolute {.unnumbered}
Absolute leaderboards rank all learners by some global measures, such as collected points. When this type of ranking is used, consideration must be given to the feeling of disappointment or discrimination that may be created against those in the bottom positions.

#### Relative {.unnumbered}
Relative leaderboards rank and group learners according to relative criteria. A common example is a view in which learners see only those students who are directly above or below them, solving the disappointment and discrimination issues.

## Gamification Strategies
There are three types of gamification strategies, Online Strategies, Classroom Strategies and Out-of-class Strategies [link to University of Waterloo]

### Online Strategies

#### Discussion Boards {.unnumbered}
Learners can be prompted to participate in online discussions, before or immediately after class, by making them optional but awarding points for each post or reply to another post. They should be able to use the collected points as an extra help on an assignment or for improving their final grade.

#### Quizzes {.unnumbered}
Instead of presenting a set of seemingly unrelated questions, the usage of interactive and narrative quizzes is suggested. This helps learners see the implications of their answers and also helps them stay engaged.

### Classroom Strategies

#### Jeopardy {.unnumbered}

Jeopardy-style [link to wikipedia] games can be used for chapter reviewing or midterm preparation and can provide enjoyment and enhance cooperation among learners in a familiar game structure.

#### Classroom Response Systems {.unnumbered}
Using classroom response systems can simplify the process of gathering responses from an entire class and can encourage participation by incorporating game elements such as point systems or leaderboards.

### Out-of-class Gamification Strategies

#### Game-based learning environments {.unnumbered}
This strategy includes all games that are designed for educational purposes and do not require the presence of an instructor to be played.

#### Game-enhanced learning environments {.unnumbered}
These environments use commercially available games designed for entertainment purposes. Learners can play these games for fun and then discuss gaming experiences with other learners.

## Pitfalls
http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/87567555.2017.1295016<br>

There are some potential pitfalls that instructors may encounter when designing game-based learning activities [refer research as Moore-Russo et al. 2017]. First, game elements may not be connected to learning objectives. For game-based learning activities to be successful, learners must be able to retain and apply the knowledge they have been exposed to through the game.
