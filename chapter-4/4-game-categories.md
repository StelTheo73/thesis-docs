# Mobile Game Categories, Genres and Subgenres

Gamerefinery has developed a flexible three-layer classification that allows mobile games to be easily grouped under distinctive genres [@gamerefinery_game_categories]. Each game is classified into a subgenre, according to its features and mechanics. This subgenre belongs to one genre, which in turn belongs to one category. This three-layered approach acts as a helpful taxonomy for market and game research, as it provides game developers a singular unified approach to categorizing games.
