# 1 Introduction

## Motivation

Quantum computing utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to process information and solve complex problems exponentially faster that classical computers. Quantum bits can exist in multiple states at the same time, offering great computational power, beyond the limits of classical computers. The development and widespread use of quantum computing can help in fields such as pharmaceuticals, cryptography, artificial intelligence, materials science and more. [@knowledgeacademy_quantum_computing], [@nagappan_quantum_computing], [@decodoku_quantum_games] Since quantum computing represents a new era for computer science, opening up new prospects for accelerating scientific discoveries, learning the basic principles of quantum computing is extremely important. The reason for my involvement with quantum computing was the course "Quantum Computing", which was offered by the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Patras.

## What is Game-Based Learning

Game-based learning is a very old practice; it did not start with the advance of modern technology. It can be defined as the technique of being educated by playing games. It integrates the characteristics and principles of games such as elements of competition, rewards and active user engagement, into learning activities. Games can be an interactive tool that can simplify challenging concepts and help learners understand complex ideas, engaging them into educational content.

## Research Objectives

The aim of this thesis is to create an educational game that will familiarize the learners with the basic principles of quantum computing, such as quantum bits and quantum gates. Then we will define some specifications that we would like the game to meet.

First, we want to design a simple and accessible educational game with few rules, clear objectives and easy to understand mechanics. We want learners to focus on the learning object and not get distracted or tired by the complexity of the game.

The game will be aimed at university students interested in quantum computing. For this reason, it will not go into depth, but will introduce basic concepts, such as quantum registers or some basic quantum gates. This is the second requirement for the game manual.

In addition, it is desirable that the game can be played at any time and in any place, without the need for equipment or a computer, simply by using their mobile phone. The third objective is that the user should be able to play even when they have limited time (e.g. travelling, waiting for public transport, etc.), so it should be light and take a short time to play.

The fourth and final objective is to make the game suitable to be played in the context of a university lecture. The game could be distributed to students during the introductory lecture of the course, or it could be used as a tool to test their knowledge from a lecture - for example, whether they understand the operation of the basic quantum gates. For this reason, it should have features that test learners' knowledge, such as a quiz.
