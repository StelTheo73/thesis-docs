# 1 Introduction

## Motivation
Quantum computing utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to process information and solve complex problems exponentially faster that classical computers. Quantum bits can exist in multiple states at the same time, offering great computational power, beyond the limits of classical computers. The development and widespread use of quantum computing can help in fields such as pharmaceuticals, cryptography, artificial intelligence, materials science and more.

## What is Game-Based Learning
Game-based learning is a very old practice; it did not start with the advance of modern technology. It can be defined as the technique of being educated by playing games. It integrates the characteristics and principles of games such as elements of competition, rewards and active user engagement, into learning activities. Games can be an interactive tool that can simplify challenging concepts and help learners understand complex ideas, engaging them into educational content.

## Benefits of Game Based Learning
First, game-based learning is more appealing to children, as it appears to be a game on the surface, but in the background it has the ability to stimulate children's curiosity and capture their imagination. It is a friendlier and more accessible mean of engaging young learners with a subject than traditional methods, as it is fun and motivating.

Game-based learning also has the ability to enhance critical thinking and problem-solving, as they involve human instinct to compete and desire to succeed. Because learners often compete with other players, they have to collaborate and share ideas. They must listen to and evaluate the opinions of other players and take into account the tactics of opposing teams.

Games often require users to react quicker to stimuli, make critical decisions in a short period of time and combine knowledge acquired during the game to solve complex problems. Due to their repetitive and interactive nature, they have the ability to improve retention and increase the brain's capacity to memorize things.

Also, as games are flexible, they can be adapted to different learning styles, levels and paces, meeting individual needs and can also give instant feedback about where gaps in knowledge are or provide specific tasks for the user to help cover these areas. In this way, they can further help learners to identify their strengths and weaknesses.

Comparing games to traditional textbooks, although the latter have been used for many years with success, their revision and renewal takes a long time and is difficult and costly. The cost of reprinting, redistributing and recycling or storing old textbooks must be taken into account. Even in the case of digital textbooks, there is a significant cost of disposal and renewal. By contrast, games are very versatile, their rules can be adapted easily, and their content can be changed quickly to keep pace with technological and scientific progress.

In summary, game-based learning offers a modern, engaging and flexible approach to education. It is a great way to improve learners' critical thinking and problem-solving skills, boost their creativity and keep them engaged and motivated. Also, unlike traditional textbooks, it can be quickly and cost-effectively updated, in order to reflect new information and technological progress.

## Research Objectives
The aim of this thesis is to familiarize the learners with the basic principles of quantum computing, such as quantum bits and quantum gates. They should not be distracted or get tired due to the complexity of the game. The aim is to design a simple and accessible educational game, with few rules and clear objectives.

In order to play this educational game, one does not need to have a university background in mathematics or a strong background in quantum physics. The game can be played by anyone who is interested in learning how quantum gates work and how they affect quantum bits.

In addition, it is desirable that the game could be played at any time and in any place, without the need of equipment or a computer. The aim is that the user can play even when he has limited time (e.g. travelling, waiting for public transportation, etc.), and for the game to be suitable for playing in a class, in the context of a lecture.

For these reasons, a classic digital game, for mobile devices, with simple mechanisms and low complexity should be chosen, whose rules and objectives should be adapted to the topic of quantum computing.
