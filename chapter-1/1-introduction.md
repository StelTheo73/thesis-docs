# Introduction

## Motivation

Quantum computing utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to process information and solve complex problems exponentially faster that classical computers. Quantum bits can exist in multiple states at the same time, offering great computational power, beyond the limits of classical computers. The development and widespread use of quantum computing can help in fields such as pharmaceuticals, cryptography, artificial intelligence, materials science and more. [@knowledgeacademy_quantum_computing; @nagappan_quantum_computing; @decodoku_quantum_games] Since quantum computing represents a new era for computer science, opening up new prospects for accelerating scientific discoveries, learning the basic principles of quantum computing is extremely important. The reason for my involvement with quantum computing was the course 'Quantum Computing', which was offered by the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Patras.

## Research Objectives

The aim of this thesis is to create an educational game that will familiarize the learners with the basic principles of quantum computing, such as quantum bits and quantum gates. Then we will define some specifications that we would like the game to meet.

First, we want to design a simple and accessible educational game with few rules, clear objectives and easy to understand mechanics. We want learners to focus on the learning object and not get distracted or tired by the complexity of the game.

The game will be aimed at university students interested in quantum computing. For this reason, it will not go into depth, but will introduce basic concepts, such as quantum registers or some basic quantum gates. This is the second requirement for the game manual.

In addition, it is desirable that the game can be played at any time and in any place, without the need for equipment or a computer, simply by using their mobile phone. The third objective is that the user should be able to play even when they have limited time (e.g. traveling, waiting for public transport, etc.), so it should be light and take a short time to play.

The fourth and final objective is to make the game suitable to be played in the context of a university lecture, used as an educational tool. The game could be distributed to students during the introductory lecture of the course, or it could be used as a tool to measure their knowledge retention after a lecture - for example, whether they understand the operation of the basic quantum gates. For this reason, it should have features that measure learners' knowledge retention, such as a quiz.

## Thesis Structure

The report consists of 7 chapters and one Appendix. The introductory chapter presents the motivation and defines the objectives of the thesis. The remaining chapters correspond to the path followed for the development of this thesis.

Chapters 2, 3 and 4 deal with the literature review. More specifically, Chapter 2 presents educational games about quantum physics, quantum mechanics and quantum computing. Chapter 3 introduces game-based learning (GBL) techniques, their advantages, the characteristics of GBL applications and some pitfalls to avoid when designing a GBL process.

Chapter 5 reviews and compares the available technologies for mobile application development and justifies the choice of the Flutter framework for our application implementation.

Chapter 6 discusses the conceptual design of the application and the adopted GBL techniques. It also presents the structure of the application, analyses the process of developing the application, and presents a high level overview of the evaluation process.

The thesis concludes with Chapter 7, which describes the evaluation process in detail. In this chapter, charts have been included to visualize the data collected and a qualitative analysis of the results is also carried out. Finally, the extracted results are presented and some suggestions for the improvement of the application are made.

In Appendix A, the screens of the application are presented in detail.
