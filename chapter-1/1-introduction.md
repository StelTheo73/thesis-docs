# 1 Introduction

## 1.1 Motivation
Why should we make a quantum game: https://decodoku.medium.com/why-we-need-to-make-quantum-games-6f8c7bc4ace7

## 1.2 Research Objectives
This educational game targets users with a mathematical background in the fields in the fields of linear algebra, probability theory and statistics.

The players should learn basic concepts of Quantum Computing

The players should not get distracted or tired by the complexity of the game. We should emphasize / prioritize learning basic principles of quantum computing. Therefore, we chose a simple game with minimal rules and low complexity.
