# 1 Introduction

## 1.1 Motivation
Why should we make a quantum game: https://decodoku.medium.com/why-we-need-to-make-quantum-games-6f8c7bc4ace7<br>

Game-based learning:
 - https://www.gamedesigning.org/learn/game-based-learning/
    * Game-based learning is learning a subject or being educated via playing games.
    * This is a very old practice, it did not start with the advance of modern technology.


## 1.2 Benefits of Game Based Learning
 - More appealing to children
 - Improves retention (keeping info in the brain)
 - Are a friendly and mor3e approachable medium to engage with a subject
 - Helps students identify their strengths and weaknesses
 - Are versatile, with the ability to combine diff

## 1.3 Research Objectives
This educational game targets users with a mathematical background in the fields in the fields of linear algebra, probability theory and statistics.

The players should learn basic concepts of Quantum Computing

The players should not get distracted or tired by the complexity of the game. We should emphasize / prioritize learning basic principles of quantum computing. Therefore, we chose a simple game with minimal rules and low complexity.
