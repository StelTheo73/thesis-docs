# 1 Introduction

## Motivation

Quantum computing utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to process information and solve complex problems exponentially faster that classical computers. Quantum bits can exist in multiple states at the same time, offering great computational power, beyond the limits of classical computers. The development and widespread use of quantum computing can help in fields such as pharmaceuticals, cryptography, artificial intelligence, materials science and more.

## What is Game-Based Learning

Game-based learning is a very old practice; it did not start with the advance of modern technology. It can be defined as the technique of being educated by playing games. It integrates the characteristics and principles of games such as elements of competition, rewards and active user engagement, into learning activities. Games can be an interactive tool that can simplify challenging concepts and help learners understand complex ideas, engaging them into educational content.

## Research Objectives

The aim of this thesis is to familiarize the learners with the basic principles of quantum computing, such as quantum bits and quantum gates. They should not be distracted or get tired due to the complexity of the game. The aim is to design a simple and accessible educational game, with few rules and clear objectives.

In order to play this educational game, one does not need to have a university background in mathematics or a strong background in quantum physics. The game can be played by anyone who is interested in learning how quantum gates work and how they affect quantum bits.

In addition, it is desirable that the game could be played at any time and in any place, without the need of equipment or a computer. The aim is that the user can play even when he has limited time (e.g. travelling, waiting for public transportation, etc.), and for the game to be suitable for playing in a class, in the context of a lecture.

For these reasons, a classic digital game, for mobile devices, with simple mechanisms and low complexity should be chosen, whose rules and objectives should be adapted to the topic of quantum computing.
