Game-based learning is a very old practice; it did not start with the advance of modern technology. It can be defined as the technique of being educated by playing games. It integrates the characteristics and principles of games such as elements of competition, rewards and active user engagement, into learning activities. Games can be an interactive tool that can simplify challenging concepts and help learners understand complex ideas, engaging them into educational content.

## 1.2 Benefits of Game Based Learning

First, game-based learning is more appealing to children, as it appears to be a game on the surface, but in the background it has the ability to stimulate children's curiosity and capture their imagination. It is a friendlier and more accessible mean of engaging young learners with a subject than traditional methods, as it is fun and motivating.

It also has the ability to enhance critical thinking and problem-solving, as they involve human instinct to compete and desire to succeed. Because learners often compete with other players, they have to collaborate and share ideas. They must listen to and evaluate the opinions of other players and take into account the tactics of opposing teams.

Another potential advantage of this learning approach is the ability to improve retention, due to its repetitive and interactive nature. As games are flexible, they can be adapted to different learning styles, levels and paces, meeting individual needs and can also give instant feedback about where gaps in knowledge are or provide specific tasks for the user to help cover these areas. In this way, they can further help learners to identify their strengths and weaknesses.



## 1.3 Research Objectives
<!-- Games are an interactive tool to simplify challenging (quantum) concepts. Integrating quantum mechanics into a game could help players understand complex ideas, such as superposition and quantum entanglement in a fun and easy way.

Games also have the potential to generate interest in quantum computing for a wide range of people, including those who have no background in quantum physics. This could help develop a more educated and engaged community around quantum technologies.

Quantum games offer novel??? gameplay -->

<!-- This educational game targets users with a mathematical background in the fields in the fields of linear algebra, probability theory and statistics. -->

The players should learn basic concepts of Quantum Computing

The players should not get distracted or tired by the complexity of the game. We should emphasize / prioritize learning basic principles of quantum computing. Therefore, we chose a simple game with minimal rules and low complexity.
