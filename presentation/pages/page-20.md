      <h2>⛔ Weak Spots</h2>
      <li>
        <strong>Narratives (5.3):</strong> storytelling is good, but could be improved.
      </li>
      <!-- I placed narratives at weak spots because some players asked for more information, especially regarding superposition -->
      <li>
        <strong>Player Engrossment (3.9):</strong> players were not fully focused on the game.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Social Connectivity (3.9) & Audio Aesthetics (1):</strong> expected, since the game is single-player and has no audio.
      </li>
    </ul>
