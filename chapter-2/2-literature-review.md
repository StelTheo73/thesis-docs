[List Of Quantum Games](https://kiedos.art/quantum-games-list/)

1) [Finnish Game Jam](https://www.finnishgamejam.com/)
    - Competition for game developers.
    - Desktop games: User must download the source files and build the game.
    - Browser games.
    - Most of the games are available on [itch.io](https://itch.io/):
    - Games created by Finnish Game Jam are not designed for educational purposes.
    - The target of this competition is to create games with limited time and resources but with unlimited creativity [[link](https://www.finnishgamejam.com/about/)].

2) [QPlayLearn](https://qplaylearn.com/)
    - Platform with web-based educational games.
    - Uses interactive tools to make the learning process more effective and entertaining for different target groups [[link](https://qplaylearn.com/about)].

3) [Quantum Games Course by Aalto University](https://quantumgames.aalto.fi/)
    - Course offered by Aalto University
    - Games are not designed for educational purposes.
    - This course is designed to teach students how to design and develop games and also learn the basic concepts of quantum computing.

4) [Science At Home](https://www.scienceathome.org/)
    - Aarhus University
    - Browser and desktop educational games
    - Diverse team of scientists, designers and game developers that create scientific games, aiming at teaching by game-play [[link](https://www.scienceathome.org/about-us/)]

5) github / gitlab
    - Lots of desktop games. Most of them use Jupyter Notebooks.
    - The majority of these games are not designed for educational purposes. They have been developed in the context of competitions or workshops.

6) [Decodoku](https://itch.io/profile/decodoku)
    - Has created a lot of quantum games. The games are hosted on itch.io.
    - The games does not have an educational purpose.
    - Most of them are designed to run on the [IBM Quantum Platform](https://quantum.ibm.com/)
    - Browser and desktop games

Conclusions:
  - Educational or not?
  - Quantum Computing or Particle Physics?
