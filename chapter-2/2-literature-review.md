# Literature Review

Once the goal of creating an educational game for learning quantum computing was established, a review of the available literature began. The aim of the literature review was to evaluate Game-Based Learning (GBL) as a learning modality, to document GBL techniques, and to find games related to quantum physics and quantum computing.

In this chapter, we will reason about game gender selection, based on the available literature. Also, we will present a list of educational games related to quantum physics and quantum computing, which have been the inspiration for the creation of our game.

## Computer Science Games for Higher Education

In order to choose a game genre, we studied the available literature to see the approach of other researchers and to choose the most appropriate genre, according to the specifications we set in section 1.3.

According to _Batisstella_ [-@battistella_games_for_teaching_computing], educational games have to be engaging and motivate learners to keep playing. Their study looked at more than 100 games related to computer science, the majority of which were digital games. 97% of the digital educational games were computer games, while only 1 game was designed for mobile devices. This observation suggests a significant lack of games available for mobile devices.

![Distribution of games per genre.](chapter-2/game_distribution_pie.png){#fig:fig201 height=50%}

The figure above, based on the aforementioned study, shows the distribution of games per genre. The most popular genre is simulation games, followed by puzzle games and adventure games. According to the researchers, most games are single-player that don't encourage cooperation or healthy competition between learners.

## Educational Puzzle Games

As we explained in σεψτιον 1.3, we want the game to be easy to use and have simple mechanics. Creating a simulation game, which is the most popular genre, may lead to complex mechanics that distract the player from the educational goal. For this reason, we decided to investigate further the second most popular genre: puzzle games.

Research by _Fakokunde_ [-@fakokunde_puzzle_games] on 141 subjects showed that puzzle games improved information retention, regardless of the learners' gender and cognitive style. Two other studies on puzzle games on puzzle games, [@idika_puzzle_games], [@srijampana_puzzle_games], confirm that this type of game can significantly improve information retention. They also report that they increase learners' active engagement with the material and enhance their understanding of the subject.

## Educational Games for Quantum Mechanics

In the literature we can find many games for quantum mechanics, which have been developed in different contexts. The earliest game for quantum mechanics that can be found in the literature is an Atari arcade game called 'Quantum' created in 1982 [@piispanen_quantum_games_history]. To date, more than 300 games related to quantum mechanics, digital and not, have been created [@piispanen_defining_quantum_games]. There are games developed in the context of competitions, as university coursework, by research groups, by universities, by companies, by independent enthusiasts and by professors or professional engineers. By extension, there are games that have not been developed for serious purposes, competition games, games designed for research purposes, commercial games and educational games. [@piispanen_quantum_games_history], [@spie_quantum_games] Due to the large number of educational games found in the literature, in this section we will focus on games developed by companies or universities with an educational purpose.

The games presented below are taken from the aforementioned studies and from the catalog on the _kiedos.art_ website. [@kiedos_quantum_games_list]

Table: Educational Games for Quantum Mechanics. {#tbl:tbl201}

[*] Under development.\
[**] They are not games in the classical sense, but are treated in the literature as a game-based learning method.

## Educational Mobile Games for Quantum Mechanics

As shown in the table in the previous section, there are 5 educational games for mobile devices. 4 of them are puzzles and 1 is a simulation. We will focus on the study of puzzle games to see how the researchers approached the topic.

Unfortunately, _Hello Quantum_, _Meqanic_ and _Q|Cards>_ are no longer available in stores, so we were unable to download them to study them. _Meqanic_ was available via online simulators on Apple mobile devices (iPhone and iPad), but we were unable to find a working version; on most simulators the game wouldn't even open, and on others it crashed on the level selection screen.

_Quantum 3_ is available in stores, so we downloaded it on a device to study it. The game's home screen has 3 options, 'Play', 'Options' and 'Tutorial. The 'Options' screen has basic setting for the game, such as volume control and language selection. There is also a button to clear game progress. The tutorial screen provides basic information about the theory presented in the game, as well as the mechanics of the game.

At the beginning of some levels there is a short presentation of the theory and instructions for that level. After the player has completed the level, the score is displayed. The player receives between one and three stars. The maximum score is achieved if the player completes the level in the minimum number of moves. When the level is completed, the player has the option of proceeding to the next level or returning to the home screen.

The game attempts to teach the player the composition of subatomic particles from quarks. Each level is a 2-dimensional match-3 puzzle. The player has to match three polygons of different colors to compose subatomic particles. There is no free choice of levels, a new level is unlocked each time the player completes the previous one. The game has very simple mechanics, as there are only 2 moves, selecting 3 polygons and swapping 2 polygons. It also offers the option of shuffling the board if no move is available.

## Conclusions

As the literature review demonstrates, the number of educational games for quantum computing available and playable for mobile devices is limited. This gap in the market reinforces our desire to develop a game for mobile devices, as it will be easy to engage with the game during a lecture or at times when the user does not have access to a computer, as explained in the introductory chapter as well. Because we are not interested in improving collaboration or other teamwork skills at this stage, we will not consider creating a multiplayer game. Finally, the strong boost to information retention from puzzle games and the possibility of using simple mechanics leads us to the decision to create a puzzle game.
