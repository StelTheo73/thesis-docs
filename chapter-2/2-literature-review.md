# Literature Review

Once the goal of creating an educational game for learning quantum computing was established, a review of the available literature began. The aim of the literature review was to evaluate gamification as a learning modality, to document gamification techniques, and to find games related to quantum physics and quantum computing.

In this chapter, we summarize the conclusions of the literature review on gamification as a learning approach in different sciences. We will also list games related to quantum physics and quantum computing, both educational and non-educational, which have been the inspiration for the creation of our game.

## Computer Science Games for Higher Education

In order to choose a game genre, we studied the available literature to see the approach of other researchers and to choose the most appropriate genre, according to the specifications we set in section 1.3.

According to Batisstella [-@battistella_games_for_teaching_computing], educational games have to be engaging and motivate learners to keep playing. Their study looked at more than 100 games related to computer science, the majority of which were digital games. 97% of the digital educational games were computer games, while only 1 game was designed for mobile devices. This observation suggests a significant lack of games available for mobile devices.

![Distribution of games per genre](chapter-2/game_distribution.png){#fig:fig201 height=50%}

The figure above, taken from the aforementioned study, shows the distribution of games per genre. The most popular genre is simulation games, followed by puzzle games and adventure games. According to the researchers, most games are single-player that don't encourage cooperation or healthy competition between learners.

## Educational Puzzle Games

As we explained in σεψτιον 1.3, we want the game to be easy to use and have simple mechanics. Creating a simulation game, which is the most popular genre, may lead to complex mechanics that distract the player from the educational goal. For this reason, we decided to investigate further the second most popular genre: puzzle games.

Research by Fakokunde [-@fakokunde_puzzle_games] on 141 subjects showed that puzzle games improved information retention, regardless of the learners' gender and cognitive style. Two other studies on puzzle games on puzzle games, [@idika_puzzle_games], [@srijampana_puzzle_games], confirm that this type of game can significantly improve information retention. They also report that they increase learners' active engagement with the material and enhance their understanding of the subject.

## Games for Quantum Computing and Quantum Physics

In the literature we can find many games for quantum computers or quantum physics, which have been developed in different contexts. The earliest quantum game that can be found in the literature is an Atari arcade game called 'Quantum' created in 1982 [@piispanen_quantum_games_history]. To date, more than 300 games related to quantum physics, digital and not, have been created [@piispanen_defining_quantum_games]. There are games developed in the context of competitions, as university coursework, by research groups, by universities, by companies, by independent enthusiasts and by professors or professional engineers. By extension, there are games that have not been developed for serious purposes, competition games, games designed for research purposes, commercial games and educational games. [@piispanen_quantum_games_history], [@spie_quantum_games] Due to the large number of educational games found in the literature, in this section we will focus on games developed by companies or universities with an educational purpose and are still playable.

The games presented below are taken from the aforementioned studies and from the catalog on the _kiedos.art_ website. [@kiedos_quantum_games_list]

[*] Under development.\
[**] They are not games in the classical sense, but are treated in the literature as a game-based learning method.

## Conclusions

As the literature review demonstrates, the number of games available for mobile devices is limited. This gap in the market reinforces our desire to develop a game for mobile devices, as it will be easy to engage with the game during a lecture or at times when the user does not have access to a computer, as explained in the introductory chapter as well. Because we are not interested in improving collaboration or other teamwork skills at this stage, we will not consider creating a multiplayer game. Finally, the strong boost to information retention from puzzle games leads us to the decision to create a puzzle game.
