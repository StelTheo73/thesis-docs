## Games for Quantum Computing and Quantum Physics
In the literature we can find many games for quantum computers or quantum physics, which have been developed in different contexts. There are games developed in the context of competitions, as university coursework, by research groups, by universities, by companies, by independent enthusiasts and by professors or professional engineers. By extension, there are games that have not been developed for serious purposes, competition games, games designed for research purposes, commercial games and educational games.

Consider:
2 tables -> games & virtual labs
-> game table: name, creator, url, platform (desktop/web), concept (entanglement, superposition etc), category/genre/subgenre

-> Say that game categories are described later on thesis

**!Consider a chapter explaining how an educational game should be designed!**
