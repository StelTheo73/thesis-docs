Gamerefinery [2278730] has developed a flexible three-layer classification that allows games to be easily grouped under distinctive genres. Each game is classified into a subgenre, according to its features and mechanics. This subgenre belongs to one genre, which in turn belongs to one category. This three-layered approach acts as a helpful taxonomy for market and game research, as it provides game developers a singular unified approach to categorizing games.
