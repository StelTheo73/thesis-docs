# Gamification and Game-Based Learning

In traditional teaching methods, textbooks and lectures are used and students are assessed through projects, assignments and examinations. Gamification is the integration of game elements, such as point systems, leaderboards, badges or other game-related elements, into conventional learning activities in order to increase student engagement and motivation. On the other hand, game-based learning is the design of learning activities so that the characteristics and principles of games are a key feature of these activities. Game elements can be categorized into three categories, which are presented below. [@spie_quantum_games], [@uwaterloo_gamification]

## Game Elements

### Point Systems

Points or Experience Systems reward students for completing tasks, just like conventional grades. They can introduce some useful features in learning environments, such as:

#### Limitless Points {.unnumbered}

While conventional grading systems collect learning artifacts that accumulate to one hundred percent of a course grade, point systems can accumulate points without a fixed end, pushing learners to do even better.

#### Flexible Goals {.unnumbered}

The courses can be structured to allow learners collect as many points as they want or force them complete a certain number of assignments to reach a desired threshold.

#### Student Choice {.unnumbered}

Learners can collect points by completing assignments or tests or any other course-relevant activities. They are free to choose how to collect points.

#### Tracking {.unnumbered}

Points can be tracked via grade books and shared with the entire class.

### Badges

Using badges can be a great way to reward learners for their work and keep them engaged and motivated. Badges can also be shared with the class to encourage competition.

### Leaderboards

The use of leaderboards is a great way to motivate learners, by providing them with constant feedback of where they rank in comparison to other group members. There are two types of leaderboards, absolute and relative.

#### Absolute {.unnumbered}

Absolute leaderboards rank all learners by some global measures, such as collected points. When this type of ranking is used, consideration must be given to the feeling of disappointment or discrimination that may be created against those in the bottom positions [@dominguez_2013].

#### Relative {.unnumbered}

Relative leaderboards rank and group learners according to relative criteria. A common example is a view in which learners see only those students who are directly above or below them, solving the disappointment and discrimination issues.

## Gamification Strategies

There are three types of gamification strategies: Online Strategies, Classroom Strategies and Out-of-class Strategies [@uwaterloo_gamification].

### Online Strategies

#### Discussion Boards {.unnumbered}

Learners can be prompted to participate in online discussions, before or immediately after class, by making them optional but awarding points for each post or reply to another post. They should be able to use the collected points as an extra help on an assignment or for improving their final grade.

#### Quizzes {.unnumbered}

Instead of presenting a set of seemingly unrelated questions, the usage of interactive and narrative quizzes is suggested. This helps learners see the implications of their answers and also helps them stay engaged.

### Classroom Strategies

#### Jeopardy {.unnumbered}

[Jeopardy-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!) games can be used for chapter reviewing or midterm preparation and can provide enjoyment and enhance cooperation among learners in a familiar game structure.

#### Classroom Response Systems {.unnumbered}

Using classroom response systems can simplify the process of gathering responses from an entire class and can encourage participation by incorporating game elements such as point systems or leaderboards.

### Out-of-class Gamification Strategies

#### Game-based learning environments {.unnumbered}

This strategy includes all games that are designed for educational purposes and do not require the presence of an instructor to be played.

#### Game-enhanced learning environments {.unnumbered}

These environments use commercially available games designed for entertainment purposes. Learners can play these games for fun and then discuss gaming experiences with other learners.

## Benefits of Game Based Learning

First, game-based learning is more appealing to children, as it appears to be a game on the surface, but in the background it has the ability to stimulate children's curiosity and capture their imagination. It is a friendlier and more accessible mean of engaging young learners with a subject than traditional methods, as it is fun and motivating.

Game-based learning also has the ability to enhance critical thinking and problem-solving, as they involve human instinct to compete and desire to succeed. Because learners often compete with other players, they have to collaborate and share ideas. They must listen to and evaluate the opinions of other players and take into account the tactics of opposing teams.

Games often require users to react quicker to stimuli, make critical decisions in a short period of time and combine knowledge acquired during the game to solve complex problems. Due to their repetitive and interactive nature, they have the ability to improve retention and increase the brain's capacity to memorize things.

Also, as games are flexible, they can be adapted to different learning styles, levels and paces, meeting individual needs and can also give instant feedback about where gaps in knowledge are or provide specific tasks for the user to help cover these areas. In this way, they can further help learners to identify their strengths and weaknesses.

Comparing games to traditional textbooks, although the latter have been used for many years with success, their revision and renewal takes a long time and is difficult and costly. The cost of reprinting, redistributing and recycling or storing old textbooks must be taken into account. Even in the case of digital textbooks, there is a significant cost of disposal and renewal. By contrast, games are very versatile, their rules can be adapted easily, and their content can be changed quickly to keep pace with technological and scientific progress.

In summary, game-based learning offers a modern, engaging and flexible approach to education. It is a great way to improve learners' critical thinking and problem-solving skills, boost their creativity and keep them engaged and motivated. Also, unlike traditional textbooks, it can be quickly and cost-effectively updated, in order to reflect new information and technological progress.

## Pitfalls {#scoring-pitfall}

There are some potential pitfalls that instructors may encounter when designing game-based learning activities [@moore-ruso_2017]. First, game elements may not be connected to learning objectives. Quite often the assignments are introduced without planning how they support the learning objectives. Also, sometimes the learning objectives are connected, but the context of the game is not. Thus, learners cannot retain knowledge or relate it to the subject. For game-based learning activities to be successful, learners must be able to retain and apply the knowledge they have been exposed to through the game. Furthermore, when students are focused on passing high stakes examinations, participating in a gamified environment can be seen as an unnecessary obstacle [@berkling_and_tomas_2013]. Learners who are used to learning and being assessed by conventional teaching methods and are focused on achieving high grades may feel deprived in a gamified environment. They will fill uncertainty, discomfort and may find it difficult to adapt to new rules. Another common pitfall is to capture the imagination of students and inspire them. In order to avoid this, opportunities for play, exploration and collaboration for new goals must be introduced [@nicholson_2012].
