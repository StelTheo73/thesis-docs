# Game-Based Learning

As we discussed in the previous chapter, we want to create an educational puzzle game, so we need to consider Game-Based Learning (GBL) techniques to integrate the educational process into the game mechanics. Continuing our literature review, we will present the benefits of GBL and some of the elements that characterize a GBL process.

## What is Game-Based Learning

Game-based learning is a very old practice; it did not start with the advance of modern technology. It can be defined as the technique of being educated by playing games. It integrates the characteristics and principles of games such as elements of competition, rewards and active user engagement, into learning activities. Games can be an interactive tool that can simplify challenging concepts and help learners understand complex ideas, engaging them into educational content.

## Benefits of Game Based Learning

First, game-based learning is more appealing to children, as it appears to be a game on the surface, but in the background it has the ability to stimulate children's curiosity and capture their imagination. It is a friendlier and more accessible mean of engaging young learners with a subject than traditional methods, as it is fun and motivating.

Game-based learning also has the ability to enhance critical thinking and problem-solving, as they involve human instinct to compete and desire to succeed. Because learners often compete with other players, they have to collaborate and share ideas. They must listen to and evaluate the opinions of other players and take into account the tactics of opposing teams.

Games often require users to react quicker to stimuli, make critical decisions in a short period of time and combine knowledge acquired during the game to solve complex problems. Due to their repetitive and interactive nature, they have the ability to improve retention and increase the brain's capacity to memorize things.

Also, as games are flexible, they can be adapted to different learning styles, levels and paces, meeting individual needs and can also give instant feedback about where gaps in knowledge are or provide specific tasks for the user to help cover these areas. In this way, they can further help learners to identify their strengths and weaknesses.

Comparing games to traditional textbooks, although the latter have been used for many years with success, their revision and renewal takes a long time and is difficult and costly. The cost of reprinting, redistributing and recycling or storing old textbooks must be taken into account. Even in the case of digital textbooks, there is a significant cost of disposal and renewal. By contrast, games are very versatile, their rules can be adapted easily, and their content can be changed quickly to keep pace with technological and scientific progress.

In summary, game-based learning offers a modern, engaging and flexible approach to education. It is a great way to improve learners' critical thinking and problem-solving skills, boost their creativity and keep them engaged and motivated. Also, unlike traditional textbooks, it can be quickly and cost-effectively updated, in order to reflect new information and technological progress.

## Elements of GBL

The following section is based on _Plass, Homer, and Kinzer_ [-@plass_gbl_2015] and _Shi and Shih_ [-@shi_gbl_2015].

### Game Mechanics

Mechanics determine the genre of the game and are the key element in linking the educational process to the game. They describe the type of activities the learner has to repeat throughout the game and can be of two types; learning mechanics and assessment mechanic.

### Visual Aesthetic Design

The Visual Aesthetic Design is the process of representing information with graphic elements (information visualization). It also defines the way in which visualized feedback is provided.

### Musical Score

The musical score includes the background sounds, the voices and haptic feedback (such as device vibration). These elements are used to direct player's attentions to important events, evoke emotions and provide feedback on player's actions.

### Narrative Design

Unlike traditional textbooks, games allow for nonlinear narratives that evolve based on player's choices. A narrative can be a dialogue, a cutscene, a voice-over or other in-game action. Narratives provide information for learning, characters, events, quests and game rules. Their aim is to increase the player's motivation to continue playing the game.

### Incentive System

The incentive system consists of motivational elements that rewards player's efforts and encourages them. Examples of incentives systems are point systems, leaderboards, stars, badges trophies and any other kind of reward.

### Adaptivity

Adaptivity refers to the ability of the game to adjust to each learner's profile, enhancing engagement and learning outcomes. To achieve adaptivity, the game should provide mechanisms to modify game elements, such as problem complexity, guidance and feedback, according to player's needs.

### Graceful Failure

Graceful failure refers to the idea that failure is not seen as a negative outcome, but rather as an essential and constructive part of the leadership process. The game can reduce the consequences of failure by encouraging players to take risks, explore and experiment, leading to increased motivation and engagement.

## Pitfalls {#scoring-pitfall}

There are some potential pitfalls that someone may face when designing game-based learning activities [@moore-ruso_2017]. First, game elements may not be connected to learning objectives. Quite often the tasks are introduced without planning how they support the learning objectives. Also, sometimes the learning objectives are connected, but the context of the game is not. As a result, learners cannot retain knowledge or relate it to the subject. For game-based learning activities to be successful, learners must be able to retain and apply the knowledge they have been exposed to through the game. Furthermore, when students are focused on passing high stakes exams, participating in a gamified environment can be seen as an unnecessary obstacle [@berkling_and_tomas_2013]. Learners who are used to learning and assessment through conventional teaching methods and are focused on achieving high grades may feel deprived in a gamified environment. They will fill uncertainty, discomfort and may find it difficult to adapt to new rules [@nicholson_2012]. Finally, using leaderboards to rank learners in comparison with others, many learners may feel disappointed or face discrimination [@dominguez_2013].
